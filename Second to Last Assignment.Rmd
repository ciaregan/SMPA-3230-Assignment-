## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

summary_names <- complaints %>% 
  count(company, issue)
```


```{r cars}
complaints %>% 
  count(company, sort = TRUE) 
```


```{r cars}


```


```{r cars}


df_transunion_issues <- summary_names %>% 
  filter(company == "TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.")

df_transunion_issues <- summary_names %>% 
  count(issue) %>% 
  filter(n>100)

ggplot(data = df_transunion_issues, mapping = aes(x = n, y = reorder(issue, n))) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Issue Count") + ylab("Issue") +
  ggtitle("Common Transunion Complaints")


```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
df_experian_issues <- summary_names %>% 
  count(issue) 
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}



```

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
